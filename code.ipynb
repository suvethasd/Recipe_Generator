      "2. **\"Risotto\" Base:** In the same saucepan, gently heat the remaining milk over low heat until it's warm but not boiling.\n",
      "3. **Assembly:** Add the mango puree to the warm milk, stirring gently to combine.  Remove from heat.\n",
      "4. **Ice Cream Incorporation:** Gradually stir in the vanilla ice cream, a spoonful at a time, until it's mostly melted and incorporated into the warm mango milk mixture. The residual heat will help melt the ice cream, creating a creamy texture.  Do not over-mix or the mixture will become too watery.\n",
